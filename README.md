## Audio_Communication_System

This is my homework for the class 'Digital Signal Processing'.

* 'figure' contains all figures generated.
* 'filter' contains all filters designed.
* 'others' contains something miscellaneous.
* 'report' contains the files used to generate the 'report.pdf' with LaTeX.



In the main function I realize the 8PSK baseband modulation, and there is an uncompleted function in 'others' to realize 8PSK modulation in carrier modulation.
